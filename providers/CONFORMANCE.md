# Native harness conformance

This ledger records live probes for the committed plugin tree. `CAPABILITIES.md` owns degradation. `PROVIDERS.md` owns provider mappings.

## Run metadata

| Field | Claude Code | Codex CLI |
|---|---|---|
| Date | 2026-09-01 | 2026-09-01 |
| Version | 2.1.257 | 0.152.0 (confirmed live, meets the minimum tested version) |
| Install | Enabled plugin, this session; reload owed after this change | Installed and enabled from a refreshed cache; re-probe owed for the three fixed failures |

## Probe ledger

| Probe | Claude Code | Codex CLI | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native manifest loads | pass 2026-09-01 | pass 2026-09-01 | Second harness: remove + add refreshed the cache, which then carried `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with no unknown-field warning |
| 40 `/afk:<x>` skills load | pass 2026-09-01 (38 listed) | pass 2026-09-01 (40 listed) | Counts differ by harness listing rules, not by catalog: 40 manifest entries = 38 model-visible + `harvest` (`disable-model-invocation: true`) + `diagnose` (absent from the first harness's model-visible listing before this change too — its own open item). The second harness lists all 40, no duplicates, no hyphenated mirrors, and the `$`-prefixed form invokes one |
| No generated mirror skills | n/a | pass 2026-09-01 | Zero hyphenated mirror names in the catalog |
| Shared hooks load and are trusted | pass 2026-09-01 | FAIL 2026-09-01 | Handlers are registered and trusted, but every cached shell handler carried CRLF, so the shell could not parse one: `syntax error near unexpected token $'do\r'`. Fixed by a scoped `.gitattributes` pinning `*.sh` to LF plus gate rule I; awaiting re-probe |
| SessionStart envelope and environment names | pass 2026-09-01 | pass 2026-09-01 | Second harness, instrumented capture: `CLAUDECODE` unset, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`/`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`/`PLUGIN_ROOT`/`PLUGIN_DATA` set, `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` unset — the adapter order (native root before compatibility markers) is the correct one. Envelope keys carry the shared set plus `model`, `permission_mode`, `turn_id` |
| CrowdStrike guard denies a system-root recursive scan | pass 2026-09-01 | FAIL 2026-09-01 | Second harness: no denial, the command reached the OS. Same CRLF root cause; awaiting re-probe |
| Stop gates block after a plugin edit | pass 2026-09-01 | FAIL 2026-09-01 | Second harness: handlers reported failure and the turn exited 0 — no gate verdict. Same CRLF root cause; awaiting re-probe |
| Shared Jira MCP tool is callable | pass 2026-09-01 | FAIL 2026-09-01 | Second harness left `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` literal in the MCP arguments, so the server never started. Replaced with a self-locating bootstrap (resolution order in `PROVIDERS.md`); awaiting re-probe |
| `afk-reader` returns a cited digest | pass 2026-09-01 | pass 2026-09-01 | Second harness: all four stubs copied byte-identical, each resolved its role Markdown through the plugin cache, and the read-only role refused the write |
| Agent sandbox and write boundaries | pass 2026-09-01 | pass 2026-09-01 | Read-only role refused on both harnesses; the target file did not exist afterwards |
| Same-child continuation | pass 2026-09-01 | pass 2026-09-01 | Both harnesses reached the same child with its nonce intact — `DELEGATION.md` may claim continuation on both |
| Cache refresh after source-only change | n/a | pass 2026-09-01 | Minimum sequence: re-run the plugin add, then start a new session. Removal first is not required |
| Script-only hook change trust behavior | n/a | pass 2026-09-01 | Editing a referenced script body left the trust hash unchanged and raised no new prompt — trust covers the handler definition, not the script it runs. Security consequence: an approved handler keeps running whatever its script later says, so the shell handlers are gated content, and the pre-commit and Stop gates are the control |
| Disable or uninstall leaves repository inert | pass (static) 2026-09-01 | pass 2026-09-01 | Second harness: after removal, zero skills, agents, MCP tools or plugin hooks, and no tracked repository file was touched. Caveat: pre-native ignored mirrors survive on a machine that once had them — the setup register's stale-activation entry offers the cleanup |
| Native contract negative probe blocks | pass 2026-09-01 | n/a | Scratch skill with a `harness:` frontmatter key, a harness-tool reference, a fallback-free project-dir read, and a harness name: gate exit 2 naming all six findings; exit 0 after removal |

## Unresolved items

- Four second-harness probes failed on two root causes, both fixed here and awaiting re-probe: shell handlers unparseable (CRLF), which took the guard denial and the Stop block with it, and the unexpanded plugin-root argument, which kept the Jira server from starting.
- `diagnose` is missing from the model-visible skill listing on the first harness although its frontmatter carries no hiding flag. Pre-dates the native migration; open as its own follow-up.


## Add harness #N

1. Add the harness row to the supported-harness registry in `PROVIDERS.md`.
2. Add `hooks/lib/providers/<name>.sh` with detect, root, and data functions.
3. Add one envelope fixture per shared event under `hooks/tests/envelopes/<name>/`.
4. Add a native manifest twin only when the harness cannot consume an existing manifest.
5. Add unchanged agent-definition stubs when the harness cannot consume `agents/*.md`.
6. Add one `CAPABILITIES.md` provider column and one `PROVIDERS.md` mapping column.
7. Add one `/afk:setup` probe section.
8. Run `hooks/tests/hook-smoke.sh` and `hooks/native-contract-gate.sh`.
9. Install through the harness enable flag. Run every probe in this ledger.
10. Record version, date, commands, verdicts, and unresolved capabilities here.
11. Confirm no skill prose changed for the harness.
